# OLA Ride Cancellation & Trend Analysis – Excel, SQL & Power BI Project
## Project Overview
This project analyzes OLA ride booking data to uncover patterns, customer–driver behavior, and business insights related to ride cancellations, revenue, and service quality. Using SQL and Power BI (DAX), the project identifies key factors impacting cancellations, explores ride performance across multiple vehicle types, and evaluates ratings to enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
## Problem Statement
Ride cancellations and inconsistent ratings affect customer experience, driver productivity, and company revenue. The objective was to:
- Identify why rides get cancelled (by customers or drivers).
- Analyze revenue loss and booking patterns.
- Measure ratings and performance trends across various OLA vehicle types (Prime Sedan, Prime SUV, Mini, Auto, Bike, eBike, etc.).
- Provide actionable insights to reduce cancellations and improve ride efficiency.

## Tech Stack
- Excel – Data preprocessing, validation, and initial trend exploration
- SQL – Data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and analytical querying.
- Power BI (DAX) – Interactive dashboard creation and visual analytics.
