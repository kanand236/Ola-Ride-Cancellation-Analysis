# OLA Ride Cancellation & Trend Analysis – Excel, SQL & Power BI Project
## Project Overview
This project analyzes OLA ride booking data to uncover patterns, customer–driver behavior, and business insights related to ride cancellations, revenue, and service quality. Using SQL and Power BI (DAX), the project identifies key factors impacting cancellations, explores ride performance across multiple vehicle types, and evaluates ratings to enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
## Problem Statement
Ride cancellations and inconsistent ratings affect customer experience, driver productivity, and company revenue. The objective was to:
- Identify why rides get cancelled (by customers or drivers).
- Analyze revenue loss and booking patterns.
- Measure ratings and performance trends across various OLA vehicle types (Prime Sedan, Prime SUV, Mini, Auto, Bike, eBike, etc.).
- Provide actionable insights to reduce cancellations and improve ride efficiency.

## Tech Stack
- Excel – Data preprocessing, validation, and initial trend exploration
- SQL – Data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and analytical querying.
- Power BI (DAX) – Interactive dashboard creation and visual analytics.

## SQL Analysis Tasks
Designed and executed multiple analytical queries and SQL views to answer critical business questions, including:
Retrieve all successful bookings.

- Retrieve all successful bookings.

- Find the average ride distance per vehicle type.

- Get the total number of rides cancelled by customers. 

- Identify top 5 customers with the highest number of rides.

- Analyze driver cancellation reasons (personal or car-related).

- Find max & min driver ratings for Prime Sedan rides.

- Retrieve all rides paid via UPI.

- Calculate average customer rating per vehicle type.

- Compute total booking value for completed rides.

- List incomplete rides along with reasons.

## Power BI Dashboard Insights
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize and interpret trends using DAX measures and calculated columns:

- Ride Volume Over Time

- Booking Status Breakdown

- Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance

- Average Customer Ratings by Vehicle Type

- Cancellation Reasons (Customer vs Driver)

- Revenue by Payment Method

- Top 5 Customers by Total Booking Value

- Ride Distance Distribution per Day

- Driver Ratings Distribution

- Customer vs Driver Ratings Comparison

## Key Insights Derived

- Most cancellations occurred due to driver unavailability and customer schedule changes.

- Prime Sedan and Prime SUV generated the highest revenue and average ratings.

- UPI emerged as the most preferred payment method.

- Notable rating gap observed between drivers and customers, highlighting potential feedback improvement areas.

- Daily ride volume showed strong peaks during morning and evening hours.

## Dataset Columns

Date, Time, Booking_ID, Booking_Status, Customer_ID, Vehicle_Type, Pickup_Location, Drop_Location, V_TAT, C_TAT, cancelled_Rides_by_Customer, cancelled_Rides_by_Driver, Incomplete_Rides, Incomplete_Rides_Reason, Booking_Value, Payment_Method, Ride_Distance, Driver_Ratings, Customer_Rating.

## Conclusion

This end-to-end analytics project demonstrates how data insights can help optimize OLA’s operational efficiency, reduce cancellations, and enhance the customer experience. The combination of SQL for backend data modeling and Power BI for visualization enables powerful, data-backed decision-making.
